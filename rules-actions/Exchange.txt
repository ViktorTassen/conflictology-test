Implementation Notes

Action Declaration Stage:

Player declares "Exchange"
System should prompt all other players for possible challenges (with a time limit)


Challenge Resolution Stage:

If challenged, system handles card reveals and influence loss
System manages card replacements


Exchange Execution Stage:

System draws appropriate number of cards for player
System presents all cards to player (old and new)
System allows player to select which cards to keep
System returns remaining cards to deck and shuffles


Privacy Considerations:

Only the active player should see the cards drawn during Exchange
Other players should see only the number of cards being exchanged
System should never reveal the returned cards to other players


UI Elements for Exchange Action:

Private card selection screen for the active player
Card array showing all available cards (current + drawn)
Selection mechanism (check boxes, drag-and-drop, etc.)
Confirmation button to finalize selections
Visual indication of how many cards must be returned


Timing Considerations:

Reasonable time limit for card selection (30-60 seconds)
Warning when time is running low
Auto-selection of cards if time expires (keep current cards)


Animation Elements:

Cards being drawn from deck
Card shuffling animation when returning cards
Clear visual distinction between kept and returned cards


Special Case:

If player has only one influence remaining, they draw 2 cards, but only select 1 to keep
System should adjust UI accordingly based on player's current influence count
