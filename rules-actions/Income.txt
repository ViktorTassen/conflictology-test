Income Action Logic Flow
Basic Action: Income

Player Action: Player announces "Income".
Valid When: Always available (no coin requirement).
Basic Effect: Gain 1 coin from the treasury.

Response Scenarios
Scenario 1: Standard Execution

Player declares "Income"
Player gains 1 coin from the treasury
Turn ends, next player begins

Important Notes:

Income cannot be blocked or challenged
There are no counter-actions to Income
This is the simplest and safest action in the game

Implementation Notes

Action Declaration Stage:

Player declares "Income"
System immediately processes the action (no player response window needed)


Action Resolution Stage:

System adds 1 coin to player's total
System advances to next player


UI Elements for Income Action:

Quick animation showing 1 coin moving from treasury to player
Simple confirmation message: "[Player Name] takes Income (1 coin)"
No waiting period or response buttons for other players


Strategic Context:

System could display optional strategy tip for new players: "Income is always safe but provides fewer coins than riskier actions"
No special UI elements needed beyond standard action selection


Game Flow Optimization:

Since Income cannot be responded to, the game should move quickly to the next player
Consider a shorter animation/pause than for contestable actions.
