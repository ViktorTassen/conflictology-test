UI Implementation for Player Interactions
General UI Flow

Action Selection Screen

Active player sees available actions (Foreign Aid, Coup, Taxes, Assassinate, Steal, etc.)
Each action shows its cost (if any) and brief description
Unavailable actions are grayed out (e.g., Coup when <7 coins)
Mandatory actions are highlighted (e.g., Coup when 10+ coins)


Target Selection Screen

For targeted actions (Coup, Assassinate, Steal), show all valid targets
Display each target's name, coin count, and influence count
Allow player to select a target


Action Announcement

System announces: "[Player Name] declares [Action]" to all players
For targeted actions: "[Player Name] declares [Action] against [Target Name]"
Animation/highlight shows the action happening


Response Window

Timer appears (e.g., 10-15 seconds)
All eligible players see response buttons:

"Challenge" (always available)
"Block with [Character]" (only when applicable)
"Pass" (always available)


First player to click a response button takes that action


Block/Challenge Resolution

System announces the block/challenge
If block: "[Player Name] blocks with [Character]"
If challenge: "[Player Name] challenges [Target Name]'s [Character]"
Original player sees response options (accept or challenge)


Card Reveal Screen

Challenged player sees their cards and selects one to reveal
All players see the revealed card with animation
System announces the outcome


Influence Loss Screen

Player losing influence sees their cards and selects one to discard
All players see which influence was lost (but not which specific card)
System announces: "[Player Name] loses influence ([Character])"


Action Resolution

System shows final outcome with animation (coins moving, etc.)
System announces: "Action succeeds" or "Action fails"
